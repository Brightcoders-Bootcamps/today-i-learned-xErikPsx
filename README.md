# Today I Learned by *Erik Parra Santill√°n*

React Native official documentation reading personal journal

## Week 1

### Fry 24, July 2020 *React Fundamentals*
Today I read about the React Fundamentals and what do I need to know to use and how it works. It acctually says that React is a library based in components that use a certain strcuture, that cointians JSX, this is a syntax that allows us write JavaScript with a kind of HTML labels, but you can acctually create them.

## Week 2

### Mon 27, July 2020 *JavaScript: Object*
Today I read about Obejects in JS. An object is representaive js data type, this type of data can store lots of collection with theirs identifiers called keys. This data type has a lot of methods that helps you to access to some specific collection inside the object lets get the information.

### Tue 28, July 2020 *React Native: Testig*
Todai I learned about testing in. The RN devs recommend us to use Static Analysis 
which it consist to improve the quality of our code, using tools like Linters and Type checking, to ensure that everything matches correctly.

### Wen 29, July 2020 *JavaScript: Grammar and types*
Today I read about some basics things from JavaScript, like the grammar, how it strctured, the Unicode use, and even the statesments. I alse read about all the declaration and the scope and uses from variables like, "var", "let", "conts" and why they're so different.

### Thu 30, July 2020 *React Native: Workflow - Running on Device*
So, I wanted to learn how to build my app wirelessly because I use my phone for builiding the apps, and having my device connected to my pc is kinda unconfortable, so I read that you can use the developer server over WiFi, you only need to build your app once using the usb connection and then confoguring it by the command promt and making some changes in your davice, so this will connect the divices to the server by using and IP address.

### Fri 31, July 2020 *JavaScript: Arrays*
Today I read about the Array object in JS, this array it's like a list og elements who hase a lot of methods tha can be used on it and make different kind of operations. This array stores data that is fully mutable, this means that is bolatile to any changes and aren't as dense as an object. The arrays only uses integer numbers as indexes, if you don't make the reference to a number, you won't get any data.

## Week 3

### Mon 3, August 2020 *React Native: Styles*
Today I learned about styles in RN. In react native you need to use a prop calles "styles", in this prop, you basically create an object that contains all the styles properties as we do in CSS, but in this case using them with cammel case instead of a dash, for example, CSS: "background-color", in RN: "backgroundColor". The model box of react native is based with flexbox, so we can use all the properties we use to use too here.

### Thu 4, August 2020 *JavaScript: Functions*
Today I learned about functions in JS. In this language is important to reuse code you write, so you can save a lot of time of writing. In these functions you use to take arguments to acces data that you'll need to make it work, this can be any variable that this function could scope, you can even declare multiple functions inside a function.

### Wen 5, August 2020 *React Native: Layout with Flexbox*
Today I learned about the layout with flexbox in react native. In RN we use flex to define how we want to plece our elements inside our components. It has several properties for the views, like "flex:n", where the number devides proportionally the view. It has also "flexDirection" that manages the direction the the elements will ordenate, it can be as columns or rows.
